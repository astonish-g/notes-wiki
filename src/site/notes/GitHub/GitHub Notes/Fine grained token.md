##### How to give fine grained token to Digital Garden?
- Click on [this link](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new) to open the token page.
- Type a **Token name** that makes you remember for which app you gave it. Like in this case you can name it *digital-garden-token*.
- Select the expiration date. Once the token is expired, you should give it again.
- Give a brief description, something like *needed token for digital garden*.
- For repository access, select *Only select repositories* and from the drop down menu, select the repository where the digital-garden repo was used as a template with the deploy button.
- Click on the *permissions* tab to expand and give *read and write* permissions to **Contents** and **Pull requests**.
- Then click on **generate token**.
- **DO NOT CLOSE** the window as it generated the token. Now copy the token and paste it in settings section of the **Digital Garden** plug-in in your *Obsidian settings*.
- You should make sure that it works with the green tick next to the Github section of the Digital Garden's settings.
- The fine grain token was given succesfully.
