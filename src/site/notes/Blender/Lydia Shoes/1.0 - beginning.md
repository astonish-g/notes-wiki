- Starting with a plane and giving the general shape from the side view. Adding more definition with extrude or edge loops. This looks more practical way.

- I feel like I have to make the insole of the shoes slightly smaller than the sole of the foot, or else the insole would stick out a lot. 
- Seems like I should raise the part that is below the pinky toe because or else the foot would be flying in it and it would look ugly.
