1. Go to **Scene Properties** from the **right bottom corner workspace** of Blender.
2. Now go to: ==Units > Length==
3. And **choose** the **unit** to something that you want to use such as centimeters..etc

> [!warning] NOT SURE
> I am still unable to change the scaling correctly. I should update this note with more information when I find out how to do it.
