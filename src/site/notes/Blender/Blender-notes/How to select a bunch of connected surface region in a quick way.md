This is a **work around** that I am using and find it quite useful:

1. I select the edges around the region of a surface that I want to select.
2. Then I create a **temporary** seam by:
	==Right click > Mark Seam
3. Then go to face selection mode.
4. Select a face that is inside the region that you want to select.
5. While **keeping** your **mouse cursor** inside the **region** that you want to **select** ==press L== on your keyboard. 
	**L = Select Linked** 

This method should select all the faces that remains **inside the seam** that you have created temporarily.
