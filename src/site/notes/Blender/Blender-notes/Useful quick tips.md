> When you **select two vertices** and hit **J** key, it will **create** a **segment/edge** between those vertices.

> If there is **vertex connected to an edge** and if that edge is the only edge that is connected to the vertex, **to remove the edge without removing the vertex**, whe you are on the X menu, instead of using *disolve edge*, which will get rid of the vertex as well, you have to **instead** select **limited disolve**.

> If you want to **select the two edge loops** which makes the two sides of a surface loop, you can select the surface loop in face selection mode and then you can go to:
> 
> **Select > Select Loops > Select Boundary Loop**

> When you want to **bevel** something and if you have some **weird issues** even though the topology is good, then, always check the **face orientation**, as this can be the reason. **Shit+N** to recalculate the external faces.

> When you select several faces that are not necessary such as inside a circle. Instead of deleting all and **recreating new faces**, you can just press **F** and it will create a new clean surface, above them all. *So this way you don't need to delete those faces?**

> While using **Looptools > Space**, you can use the edges too instead of vertices. **Sometimes** it gives **better results**. I guess that the **difference** of this compared tothe **vertex** mode is that it keeps the **boundaries** of the edges **untouched**, and it does everything insode of the region. 

> **Add** and **edge loop** next to the **fillets** to **avoid** having **stretching**. Bit still, before doing this, try it, I am not sure if it is necessary on a *low poly* modelling.
