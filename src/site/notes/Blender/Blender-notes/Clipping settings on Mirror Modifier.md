When you **mirror** an **object** with a **mirror modifier**, it is **not necessary** to always put the **last vertices** on the **mirroring axis**. What to do if you don't want to line the last vertices one by one to **save time**?
- ==Turn the clipping on==, on the **modifier settings**.

This way you can just pass the vertices further the axis and it should mirror just fine. As mentioned above, can be useful to save some time.
