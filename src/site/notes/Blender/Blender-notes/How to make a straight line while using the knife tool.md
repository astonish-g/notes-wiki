1. Obviously **select** the **knife tool** first by **pressing** on **K**.
2. **Click** on the **first vertex** that you want to **snap** the beginning of your **cutting line** to.
3. Press ==A== and this will make the rest of the **cut straight** by creating a straight **template** where you can choose the rotation of the cut.
