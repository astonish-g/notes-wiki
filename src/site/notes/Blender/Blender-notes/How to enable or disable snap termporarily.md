- While moving the vertex..etc with **G**, **during the move**, hit ==CTRL== and the snap will **enable** termporarily. If your snapped was enabled in the beginning, then press ==CTRL== will **disable**  the snap temporarily. 

> [!warning] Choose the correct snap mode 
> Remember to be in the **correct snapping mode** while doing this. Like when you want to enable the snapping for vertex temporarily, make sure that the **vertex** option is **selected** in the **snap toolbar**.
