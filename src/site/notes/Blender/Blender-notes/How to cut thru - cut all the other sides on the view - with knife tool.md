##### Making a non-linear cut:
1. Select the **knife tool** by pressing ==K==.
2. **Click** on the point where your **cut** will **start**.
3. **Press** on **C** ~~before~~ making the **second click** where the cut will **end** or **continue**.
4. **After** clicking on where the cut should **end**, you should **confirm** the cut with **enter key**.

> This will result with a cut that will go thru on the other side of the view and cut it completely on the view.

##### Making a straight-cut like this:
1. Select the **knife tool** by pressing ==K==.
2. **Start** the **cut** and then **press** on **A** to set it as a **straight cut**.
3. Then again, **press** on **C** ~~before~~ making the **second click**. 
4. Finally, **confirm the cut** by pressing **enter**.

> The example above will cut thru a straight line on the view.
