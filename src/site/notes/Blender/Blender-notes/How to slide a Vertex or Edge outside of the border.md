##### Problem:
When you **press** ==G== **twice**, you know that you can **slide** the vertex or edge loop but you see that it doesn't let you move further the current boundary/limit of the vertex or the edge.

##### How to slide outside of those boundaries?
To be able to slide **towards exterior**, further the boundries of the form, **after pressing G twice**, press on ==ALT== while moving and it will slide the vertex or the edge loop that you selected, **outside the boundries**.
