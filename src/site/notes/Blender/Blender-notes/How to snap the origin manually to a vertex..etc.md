1. On the **top right** corner of the **3D Viewport**, you have a **drop down** menu called ==options==. These are the **transform options**. 
2. Put a **tick** next to the **origin**. This will **enable** the **origin** to be **transformed** (moved..etc) **like a vertex**.
3. In the ==object mode==, **select** the **origin**.
4. Now with the **vertex snap** enabled, **move** the **origin** towards the **vertex** that you want to **snap** it by **pressing the G** key ==after== selecting the origin.
5. Thsis should snap it to that vertex.
