1. Select your object and go to the **modifiers** window and select ==simple deform== modifier.
2. Choose **bend** and play with the **angle to deform**.

> [!note] Note -1
> If you realize that it deforms strangely, remember to apply the transforms first and check that your face normals are correct. *( outside and back face ).

> [!note] Note -2
> If you have a closed object, make sure that it is **"solid"**, completely closed. Even if it had invisible faces with an other, touching object. Because or else, you may have issues during the deformation.
