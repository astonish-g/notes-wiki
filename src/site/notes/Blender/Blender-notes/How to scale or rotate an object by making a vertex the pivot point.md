1. **Select** the **vertexes** that you want to **scale**..etc.
2. **Lastly** select the **vertex** that you want to use as a **pivot point**.
3. The **last** selected **vertex** should be **hightlighted** in a different colour. This means that this is the **active vertex**. 
4. On the **top bar**, choose the **"Active Element"** in the **"Transform Pivot Point"** drop down menu.
5. Now when you scale, rotate..etc your object, it will use the ==last selected / active vertex== as your ==pivot point==.
