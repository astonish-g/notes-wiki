- You should have some faces inside the volume, preferably quads. 
- **Select** the **vertices** that should create the edge of the **circle**.
- **Right click** on the vertices and go to: 
	==Looptools > Circle==

This will create a circle shape with the available vertices. If necessary, you can rotate it slightly for the faces and edges to look nicer.
