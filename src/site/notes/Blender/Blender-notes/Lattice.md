1. Press **Shift+A** and select lattice.

> [!warning]
> Make sure that the **3D cursor** is set to the origin of the object.

2. **Resize** the lattice so that it is **SLIGHTLY** bigger than the object on all the axis.
3. Then **first** select the **object** and **then** the **lattice**.
4. Press **Ctrl+P** and from the menu that opens, **select** ==Lattice Deform==.
5. Now select the **lattice** and hit ==TAB== to go into the **edit mode**.
6. **Deform** the object **with the lattice**.

> [!note]
> You can add **edge loops** to the **lattice** from the lattice menu on the side panel.

7. Once happy with the result, you can select the object and **apply** the 'lattice modifier'. *( It adds itself as a modifier to the object )*
