- First **put** the **transform pivot point** to the **active element** on the **top bar**.
- Then **select** the two vertexes that needs to be **alligned** to a third one (or fourth, sixth..etc). 
- Now select the vertex (it will have a different color, compared to the other selections as it will be the active object)
- Finally, use the command **sy0** and the first two vertexes will be alligned to the third one on the y axis.
