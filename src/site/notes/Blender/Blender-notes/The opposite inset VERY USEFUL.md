When you are working with the **subd surface** and you want to create an inset as a **support edge loop**:
- Select the surface loop that you want to inset.
- Press ==O== (letter) 
This will create an **edge loop** to the **surfaces** that are **connected** to the **selected surface**. 

You can **flip** the **inset direction** by pressing ) again, in case you don't want to place edge loops to the connected surfaces.  

Then if you want, you can press I again and inset the selected surface loop as well. This way both of the surfaces will have the **supporting edge loops**.
