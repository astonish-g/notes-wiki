##### Info:
Sometimes you may want to store a value in a variable but **variables can change**. What if you do **NOT want** the **stored value** to **change** throughout the execution of the program. 

Apparently you do this with **constants** on other programming languages but **Python** do **NOT support** constants. 

To **work around** this, you **use all capital letters** to **name** a **variable** to indicate that the variable should be **treated** as a **constant**.

For example:

```Python
FILE_SIZE_LIMIT = 2000
```

When encountering variables like these, you **should NOT change their values.** These variables are **constant by convention**, not by the rules.
