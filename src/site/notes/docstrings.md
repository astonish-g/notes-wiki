##### Info:

Docstrings is a documentation string that you put as the first lines in a code block, for example, a **function**. 

The docstrings **begin** with **triple quotes ( """ )** and ends with **triple quotes ( """ )** 

**There are two types of docstrings:**
- One-line docstrings
- Multiline docstrings.

**Here's an example of a one line docstring:**

```Python
def quicksort(): 
""" sort the list using quicksort algorithm """
```

> [!Warning]
> There should be **NO** blank lines either **before** or **after** the docstrings.
