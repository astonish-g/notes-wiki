##### Info:
To get input from user, you use the `input()` function. 

For example:
```Python
value = input('Enter a value:')
print(value)
```

The output of this code will be :

```
Enter a value:
```

However you should **remember** that the `input()` function **returns** a **string** and **NOT** and ==integer==.

You can put that to a variable as well and it will ask for a user input and assign it to a variable. For example:

```Python
price = input('Enter the price ($):')
```

And this will output as:

```
Enter the price ($):
```
