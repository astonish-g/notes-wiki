##### Problem:
In Obsidian, you can create **internal links** to jump between your notes from one note to an other. Sometimes the name of the note can be too long or you may want to use just one word, that fits the context or the sentence in which you want to use the link. 

##### Solution:
The normal way of adding internal links is this:
`[[the name of your link/note\|the name of your link/note]]`
and this will appear as:
[[the name of your link/note]]

What if you want to put that internal link but you want it to appear as "Linux"? Here's the correct way of doing it:
`[[the name of your link/note\|Linux]]`
And this will be the result:
[[the name of your link/note|Linux]]

==Note that both of the links above, point to the same note.==

This is such a nice way to keep your notes cleaner.
