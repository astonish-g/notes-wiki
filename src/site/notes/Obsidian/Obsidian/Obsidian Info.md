##### How to apply css mods to Obsidian?
- You should place it into the **/.obsidian/snippets/** folder of your vault folder. For example my vault folder is called *garo-obsidian-notes* so I had to place it in **~/Documents/garo-obsidian-notes/.obsidian/snippets/** and then from the settings you should enable this css snippet. 
- Once applied, from the *Appearance* menu, whenever you make a change to the .css file and save it, it will be updated immediatly.

##### How to type /<example/> type of words in Obsidian?
When you type **\<** and **\>** symbols in Obsidian, they will be considered as html tags and they won't be rendered. So to render them correctly to use in your notes, you should escape them to register them as normal characters. 
- So typing it as `/<example/>` will render it as **\<example\>**

##### How it looks my Obsidian? (Trying to import an image link)
So this is how it looks:

You can create a Github repo to store all of your screenshots to add in your Obsidian note files. This way you will never loose them.

##### Emojis do not appear? how to fix?
To fix this, you have to install emoji fonts. Do this to install emoji fonts:
```
sudo pacman -S noto-fonts-emoji
```
And once you install the fonts, it should start rendering the fonts correctly. Enjoy using them üòú

The other plug-in üîÜ is nice too but it is a little bit slow üôÅüíî

##### Using an image hosted in GitHub

1. Upload the image / push the image to the Github repository
2. Then once it is in the GitHub repository, instead of clicking on the image and selecting *copy link* open the image in your browser from the GitHub repository.
3. Then **right click** on the image and select *open image in new tab*
4. Then copy the link that the image opens in. Or else it will look like a broken image.
