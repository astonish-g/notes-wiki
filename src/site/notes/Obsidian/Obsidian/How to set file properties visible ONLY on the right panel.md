> [!tip] Obsidian File Properties
> By default, in Obsidian, the file properties appears on top of your each note, but it looks ugly in my opinion. So if you want, you can put that to hidden and make it only visible on the right side panel.

##### How to do it?
1. Go to **Obsidian settings > Editor** and set the value of:
	*Properties in documents:* ==hidden==
2. Go to **Obsidian settings > Core plugins** and **enable** ==Properties view== plug-in. 
3. Then as for the last step, while you are typing a note, press `ctrl+p` to bring the *command menu* and type: ==Properties view: Show file properties== and press **enter** to apply.

From this moment on, the **document properties will be invisible** on the top of the note file and to see them, you can open the *right side bar* and see the document properties.
