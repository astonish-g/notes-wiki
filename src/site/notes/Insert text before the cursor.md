##### Info:
The same way like appending the text to the end of the line, you can also insert text just before the cursor.

##### How to do this?
1. Always in **NORMAL** mode, **navigate** your **cursor** to the character that you want to type before.
2. **Press** the key ==i== 
3. Now you will see that you can start inserting text just before the cursor.
