##### Info:
Now that the modelling is kind of finishing and need to pass to the phase of substance painter, there are still some modifications that I have to finish to be able to seal the modelling.

##### To do:
- [ ] Fix the concave surface on the side of the insole to avoid having the shading issues.
- [ ] Fix the general shape and position of the straps with the rectangular profile.
- [ ] Make a copy of the **curves** and then **convert to mesh** the **dupplicate** of the curve.
- [ ] Make the **round** ending shape of the straps.
- [ ] Reput the rivets.
- [ ] Make the hole for the insole.
- [ ] Make the holes for the bucket.

##### Final steps:
- [ ] Optimize the model.
- [ ] Unwrap the model.
- [ ] Export to Substance Painter.
