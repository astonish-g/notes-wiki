You can make **Firefox** go full screen inside the window, so that it acts as if it is a **web app**.
##### How to achieve this?
1. **Type** into the **adress bar** `about:config` and press **enter**.
2. **Search** for `full-screen-api.ignore-widgets`.
3. **Set** the value of it to `true`.
##### Firefox hotkey for full-screen?
Press `F11` to enter to the full-screen. On the **Nuphy** keyboard, since you do **not have** F11, then you should press `FN+-` to imitate it.

> Before entering to the full screen, make the window, full-screen with your window manager's full-screen hotkey. For example I mostly set it to **SUPER+F**. After setting the app full-screen, inside your Firefox, enter to the full-screen by **clicking** to the video's control buttons.
