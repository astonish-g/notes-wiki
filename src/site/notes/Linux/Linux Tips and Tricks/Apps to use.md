- **Black Box :** This terminal looks nicer and you can hide the headerbar and it looks much nicer that way. You can use and backup the used theme by right clicking on the terminal and:
	> **Preferences > Terminal > Theme > Open Theme Folder**
	> and copy paste the themes from one computer to an other.

- **Notesnook :** To take notes. Login with the Hotmail account. Use it as a web app as this way you won't have an header.

- **Htop - Btop :** Two nice apps to see system resource useage from terminal.

- **Typora :** Use this beautiful simple looking app to open and read markdown text files.

- **PureRef :** A nice app to see referance photos.

- **Terminal Shell:** Use Zsh as shell for terminal. This is not an app but it is a shell to install to your standard terminal.

- **TLDR:** This is a **command line tool**, it puts more understandable **manual** pages for the command. For example, you want to know what "sudo" does as a command. So you type:
	> **tldr sudo**
	>
	>and it **explains the command**, with examples, in a more **user friendly** way. Amazing stuff.
	>
	>You can just install it with:
	>
	>**sudo dnf install tldr**
