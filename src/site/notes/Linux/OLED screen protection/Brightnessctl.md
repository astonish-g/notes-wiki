##### General Info:
This is a small ==Wayland specific== terminal app, that let's you set the brightness of your IPS display with a simple command.

[Brightnessctl GitHub page](https://github.com/Hummer12007/brightnessctl)
##### How to install?
You can **install** it with `yay brightnessctl`

##### How to use it?
First of all, **open** your **terminal** and execute a command like this:
```bash
brightnessctl set %20
```
So the command **above sets** the **brightness** to **20%**.
```bash
brightnessctl set %75
```
And the command **above sets** the **brightness** to **75%**.

Simple as that. For more info and commands, check `man brightnessctl`
