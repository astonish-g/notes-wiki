When you install my dot files, there are **some apps that you need** to be sure that you have for it to **work correclty**: a

- **Waybar** = For top bar replacement
- **Alacritty** = For terminal replacement
- **Kity** = As an alternative terminal
- **Swaybg** = To set and change the wallpaper
- **ULauncher** = App launcher
- **Nemo** = File explorer
- **Nemo-fileroller** = To add *extract here* ..etc buttons to the right click menu 
- **.oh-my-bash** = To make the terminal beautiful
- **feh** = Need it as an image viewer for my help files
- **glow** = For help files as an .md (*markdown*) reader
- **grim** = App for screenshot in Wayland
- **slurp** = App for selecting region (*for screenshot in my case*) for Wayland

###### My personal extra apps:
- **Obisidan** = For note taking
- **Blender** = For 3d modelling
- **Neovim** = Vim like text editor
- **Code** = Open source VSCode for Linux.

###### MODS I had to do to my dotfiles for the new installation:
- I had to change the values for the `#workspaces button` element in the waybar configuration. I had to play with the `font-size` , `margin-left` and `margin-rght` for it to look like my old set-up. 
- I have noted that installing Gnome changed the padding again. So may be install Gnome as base and it may work good out of of the box without the changes. Tomorrow try the old settings.
