When I was running Waybar's **upower module** it was giving me **segmentation fault (core dumped)** error. The **configuration** was ==correct== so I did not know why it was happenning.

After searching the web about it. I found out that, **installing the git version** fixes the issue. I tried it and yes, it **fixed it** for me. So **install** the git version. The ==waybar-git== **AUR package** is depreceted. So you may have to compile it on your own.
