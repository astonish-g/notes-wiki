##### What type of RGB or RGBA colours you should use for Hyprland border colours?
The colour format is slightly different compared to the standard RGB that I am used. You can do in these ways:
- You can use **RGB** with **hex colour code** in paranthesis. For example:
	`rgb(f38ba8)`
- You can use **RGBA** with **hex colour code** in paranthesis, but the first two letters will be the alpha:
	`rgba(fff38ba8)`
	So on the line above, the first `ff` letters should be the alpha values but it doesn't seem to work, so try to search more about it and **learn it better**.
