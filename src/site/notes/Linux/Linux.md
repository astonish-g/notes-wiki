Linux is a family of [[open-source\|open-source]] Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux Kernel. It has several distributions that they call *distro* and also it has several flavours, which they call *desktop-environment* and *window-manager*. 

##### Linux Distributions:

Here is a list of Linux distros that I have tried:

- [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/)
- [Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org/)
- [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/)
- [PopOS](https://pop.system76.com/)
- [EndeavourOS](https://endeavouros.com/)
- [CachyOS](https://cachyos.org/)

From all of these Linux distros, I loved using the Fedora distro, but also I enjoyed using EndeavourOS for the ease of installation, but also for the [[Arch wiki\|Arch wiki]] page that has an extensive info about Linux. Also, for [[Linux/Hyprland/Hyprland\|Hyprland]], I find that [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) has more information about the installations, tutorials, troubleshooting, workarounds and guides.
