By default, [[Linux/Gnome/Gnome\|Gnome]] does not resize windows with ==SUPER+Right Mouse Click== like the window manages. Since I am used to this with the [[Linux/Hyprland/Hyprland\|Hyprland]] and I like using my computer this way, I searched and found the way to do it on Gnome as well. 
###### How to do this? 
- Open your terminal
- Execute the command below in terminal:
	```bash
	gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences resize-with-right-button rue
	```

After executing this command, you can now start **resizing** your **windows** with **SUPER+Right Mouse Click and drag** like in the window managers.
