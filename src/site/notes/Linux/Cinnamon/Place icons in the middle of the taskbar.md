##### Introduction:
By default, the shortcuts icons on the taskbar are placed **next** to the **app launcher** button. To **move** them to the **center** like in Windows 11 follow the steps below.

##### Solution:
- **Right click** on the **taskbar**.
- **Enable** the **Panel edit mode**.
- **Click** and **drag** the **app shortcut icons** to the **center**, on top of the **green** region.

> [!warning] 
> There is a very specific place/point where you have to place/put the things that you drag on the green region. So if it keeps moving the applets that you move to their previous position, it means that you still didn't find the correct point to drag on your applets. Just keep trying, it should eventually work.

- Once you placed your applet in the desired position, right click again on the taskbar and **disable** the **edit mode**.
