##### Introduction:
Sometimes when you change the theme on Cinnamon, the tray icons can be smaller than what you really want. But you can easily fix this.

##### Solution:
- Right click on the **taskbar** and choose **Panel Settings**.
- In the window that opens, go to the **Panel Appearance** section and choose **right zone**.
> We chose **right zone** because we have the tray icons on the right. But if you had them on the center or left, you should choose the correct zone for that.

- Change the value of ==Symbolic icon size (px)== to something different according to your requirement.
