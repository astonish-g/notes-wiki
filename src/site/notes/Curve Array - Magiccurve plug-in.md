Use this plug-in to extract the edge loops of the surface as a curve and this will extract them to curves with the correct normals. You need this to do the rivets. so check at home if you have it. If you don't, install it again to do the curves with the new form of the surfaces.

It is a paid plug-in, but if i am not wrong, you can download and install it for free from the Gumroad page.

##### How to use it?
- Go to **edit mode**.
- Go into **vertex mode**.
- **Select** the **vertices** where you want to **extract** the curve.
- On the side panel, that you open with **N**, inside the Curve Array Plug-in properties, click on:
	- **Magic Curve > Smooth**

This will create a curve from the selected vertices, with the correct normals to place the rivet array on.
