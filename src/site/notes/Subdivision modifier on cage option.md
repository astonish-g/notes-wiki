##### Problem:
When you use subdivision modifier, and when it is **on** and you go into **edit mode**, you see that your model goes **back** to the *un-subdivided* state in a *phantom* view but you may **prefer** to have your **edges** on the subdivided forms.

##### Solution:
- Add **subdivision modifier** to your modifiers.
- In the **modifier panel**, next to the modifier's **title**, so in this case, next to the **subdivision**, you have a **triangle shaped icon**. It is called **On Cage**. Click on it to **enable** it.
- Now you wil see your **edges follow the subdivided shape**.
