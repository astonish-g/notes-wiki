##### Info:
NVChad **Cheatsheet** let's you see all the **necessary** keybindings. So it is very useful especially in the beginning.

##### How to access it?
There are basicly two ways of accessing it:
1. leader + ch
2. Or in **Normal** mode, type ==:NvCheatsheet==

Both of them should work and give you the same result.
