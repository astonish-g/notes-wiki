##### Info:
You can use the `split()` method to seperate a string into a list item by specifying the separator.

##### Here's an example:
The `split()` method **splits** the **string** into **substrings** if it finds instances of the **specified separator:**

```Python
a = "Cheers, Friends!"
print(a.split(",")) 
```

So the output of the above command will give this:

```
['Cheers', ' Friends!']
```

On the example above, "==,==" was **chosen** as a **separator**.
