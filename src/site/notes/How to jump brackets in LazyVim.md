##### Info:
Sometimes when I write a code, the code editor completes the brackets..etc automatically but once I write inside to the bracket, I realize that it becomes cumbersome to always move with the arrow keys. 

##### Here's a workaround:
Once you finish typing inside the bracket, you can:
1. Go **back** to the **normal** mode by pressing **Esc** key.
2. Then you can **append** to the **end of the line** by pressing ==A== key.

> Remember that the A key should be **CAPITAL** letter.
