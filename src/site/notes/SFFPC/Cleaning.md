- Use something like a [Swifter Microfiber Duster](https://www.amazon.com/Swiffer-Staubmagnet-Starterset-Griff-T%C3%BCcher/dp/B006VABXBS/ref=sr_1_21?keywords=swiffer%2Bduster&qid=1703989478&sr=8-21&th=1) to clean the dust of them.
- Use an air-blower but:
	- HOLD the fans while doing that to avoid:
		- breaking the bearings.
		- creating static electric.
	- Use a bracelet or something to ground yourself.
