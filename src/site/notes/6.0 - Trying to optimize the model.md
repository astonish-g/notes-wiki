##### Info:
I will use this note to track the optimizations that I was able to make on my model. This will going to be a tough task.

##### 1.0 Beginning:
The initial **high poly** model, is:
- Without the floor
- Without the feet and the nails

is ==95.982== triangles.

##### 2.0 First Optimization step:

- Optimized **ONLY** the **rivets** by **deleting** half of the edges.
- Without the floor
- Without the feet and the nails

the result is ==74.178== triangles.

###### Optimized (top) vs un-optimized (bottom):

Even when they are optimized, just **only the rivets** are ==21.920== triangles. So this is not very easy to optimize as a model to a very low value. This firken shoe just has too many details! Pfff! Getting lost. ==Keep concentrated.==
##### Third optimization step:

- All the optimizations above.
- **Disolved** a bunch of **edge loops** from the surfaces.
- **Deleted** many **unseen** faces. Can be further improved but not by much.

The result is ==49.674== triangles.

##### Fourth optimization step:
All the optimizations above and:
- Deleted extra edge loops.

The result is ==43.021== triangles.
