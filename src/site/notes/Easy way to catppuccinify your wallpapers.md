To take a wallpaper and turn it into something that fits better the **catppuccin** theme, use a **CLI app** called ==catppuccinifier==.
##### How to install?
- You can install it with **yay**: `yay catppuccinifier-cli-git`

For **more information**, visit the [Github page](https://github.com/lighttigerXIV/catppuccinifier) of the application.

##### An example of useage:
```bash
catppuccinifier -i fuji.jpg
```
- Either you can **go** to the **directory** of the **image** and use the **command** like **above**.
- **Or** you can **type** the **path** of the **image** from where you are.

##### More options:
```bash
catppuccinifier -f mocha -i fuji.jpg
```
On the **command above**, it generates **only** the **mocha** flavor of the wallpaper. **Or else**, it will generate all the **4 flavors + OLED version**.
