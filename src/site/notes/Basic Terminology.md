##### Info:
Here you will find some descriptions for the basic terminology of Python and Coding languages when I come to them.

- ###### Expressions:
	For example 2+2 is an expression. Or typing a string 'Garo' is an expression.

- ###### Statement:
	For example when you type something like:
	```Python
	myname = 'Garo"
	```
	This is a statement. It tells that my name equals to Garo. Here we are assigning the value of *Garo*, and it is a *string value*, and we are assigning that to the *variable* **myname**. So this is a statement.
