##### Solution 1 - Not Perfect
- You have to try to rotate the heel part with only the vertices of the heel selected and with the **proportional editing objects** ==activated==.
- Then you have to **adapt** all the rest to the **heel**.

##### Solution 2 - Better
- With the surfaces you choose to edit, **select them all**.
- Go to **edit mode**.
- **Select** vertices of **several surfaces**.
- **Move** the **vertices** in **X-Ray** mode.

The second solution gave me better results as with the first solution, I was having weird surface twisting (normal because of the chosen method).
