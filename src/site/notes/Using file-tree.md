##### Info:
It is self explanatory. It explains how to use the file tree.

###### How to open?
You can open the **file tree** with ==\<leader>e==

###### How to toggle on and off the file tree?
You can do it with ==Ctrl + n== 

###### How to navigate between the file-tree and the buffers?
You can use ==Ctrl+h,j,k,l== keys to navigate between the buffer and the file-tree or inside the file tree.

> [!Tip]
> Seems like **Ctrl+n** is enough to **open, toggle on and off** the **file-tree**.
