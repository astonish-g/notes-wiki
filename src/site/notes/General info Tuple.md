##### Info:
Tuple works very similar to the Lists, but the **main difference** is that the items in the list can **NOT** be changed. 

Also to define a **tuple**, you should use **paranthesis** instead of **square brackets**.

**Example:**
```python
dimensions = (200, 50)
print(dimensions[0])
print(dimensions[1])
```

So it is advised to use them when you want to store a set of values that should not be changed throughout the life of a program.
