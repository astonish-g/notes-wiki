##### Problem:
Sometimes you want to align a vertex, or several vertexes on X,Y or Z axis to an other vertex. But when you choose the vertexes and scale to 0 on the axis that you want, it feels like it is choosing a random line to scale them all. 

###### Solution 1 - Align to Active Vertex:
- Select your vertexes.
- Finally select the vertex that you want to use **as reference** for alignment because it should **be** the **active** element. It should have a **different colour** compared to other selected vertexes - *depending on your Blender theme*.
- On top, where you have your **Transform Pivot Point** options, choose **active element**.
- Now if you scale the the vertices with, for example, **S + Z + 0**, you will see that **all** of your **vertices** will be **aligned** according to the **position** of your, *last selected*, **active vertex**.

###### Solution 2 - Align to 3D Cursor:
You can achieve the same result with 3D cursor too. This let's you align your vertices to different positions other than the selected vertices. So it is useful too.
- Place your **3D Cursor** to the **reference point** where you want to **align** your **vertices**.
- Again, on top, where you have your **Transform Pivot Point** options, choose **3D Cursor**.
- Now if you scale the vertices like on the example above, on an axis, your **pivot point** or let's say **reference point** will be the position of your 3D cursor.
