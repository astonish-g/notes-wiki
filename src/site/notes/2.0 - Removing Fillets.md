##### How to bring the teoric lines to modify the fillets?
Use Meshmachine. It is really amazing to be able to bring back the teoric lines by removing the fillets.

##### How to do it? 
- Select the faces of the bevel
- Press **Y** on your keyboard to open the MeshMachine **menu**.
- In the menu that opens, press **D** or press on **Unfuse** to remove the bevel and turn it into a chamfer.
- Then press **Y** again to open the **menu** and press on **Unchamfer** or **C** to remove the chamfer and bring back the teoric lines.

>Sometimes you may have problems because if you have n-gons, the plug-in may refuse to work and give an error. In such case, you may have to remove the n-gones manually, and then retry the plug-in. It should work.
