##### Info:
Sometimes you may want to use some **character** that are considered as the part of a function, operator..etc which you may only want as a string. So in that case, you have to **escape the character**.

##### To do so?
You have to **use** the **character** `\` in Python **before** the **character** that you **want** to **escape**.

##### For example:
```Python
txt = "We are the so-called \"Vikings\" from the north."
```

##### Escape Character
Here are list of some of the **escape characters** used in **Python.**

`\'` = Single Quote

`\r` = Carriage Return ==(?)==
`\t` = Tab ==(?)==
`\b` = Backspace ==(?)==
`\f` = Form Feed ==(?)==
