##### Info:
Sometimes when you install Hyprland on top of an other DE, **especially KDE**, you will notice that it may not save your WIFI connection passwords. So each time that you log in, you may have to re-enter the wifi password. 

##### How to fix this issue?
Thankfully there is an easy fix for this:
- You have to **forget** the **connection**.
- Then you have to **reconnect** with **nmcli** or **nmtui**.

>[!Note]
>I suggest you to use NMTUI as it is much easier and you don't need to remember bunch of commands.
