- ##### Set Flow:
	This plug-in finds the best curvature position between two edge loops and set's the selected edge loop's position according to the other loops around it. So it kind of works like **Looptools relax** function, but some find this better.

- ##### Looptools:
	This is an other interesting plug-in which comes free Blender. Use it especially to make:
	- **circle** from your selected **vertices**.
	- **relax** the tension between the **vertices**.
	- **space** the **vertices** evenly.
	No need for a link for the plug-in as it **comes bundled** with **Blender**. You just **need** to **enable** the add-on in **preferences**.

- ##### Easy HDRI:
	This is a very nice plug-in that helps you to switch between HDRI environments quickly inside your project to see and find the best one for your needs. Definitely suggest using it.
