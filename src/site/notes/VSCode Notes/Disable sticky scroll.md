> When you are **scrolling down** your code, you can see **nested** current **ellement's parent stick** to the **top**. It may be annoying especially if you are searching for a minimal look and feel on your VSCode.

###### How to disable this function?
1. Go to `File>Preferences>Settings`
2. Search for `sticky scroll`
3. **Disable** it if it is enabled.

After doing this, your VSCode should not stick the parent of the nested objects and it should act more minimal.
