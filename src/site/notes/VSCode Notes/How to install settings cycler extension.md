##### Problem:
Unfortunately, even though I export my settings, ==at least for now==, it doesn't import the **settings cycler** extension even though it is in my VSCode folder. So, you have to install it **manually**. Thankfully, the saved custom settings of the extension is imported though, so most probably you will only have to install the extension and **your settings will be already there**.

##### Solution:
1. First of all go to the [website](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hoovercj.vscode-settings-cycler)of the **settings cycler** plug-in. You will see that they suggest you to copy a small code and paste it in **Ctrl+P** command dialog box and press enter, but, ==do not do that==, because somehow, it does **not work** for me.
2. On the right side of the description, you will see =="Download Extension"== button, press that and download it to your computer.
3. Open your **VSCode**, and **install** it **manually** by going to the **extensions** section of the app. You can do that either by clicking on the extension icon on the **"Activity Bar"** on your left, or you can simply press **Ctrl+Shift+X**.
4. On the top left corner, click on the **three dots** button and select =="Install from VSIX..."==.
5. From the window that opens, browse to the directory where you have downloaded the extension and open it to install it. It will install the extension and it will ask you to reload the VSCode and now you have succesfully installed **settings cycler extension**.
