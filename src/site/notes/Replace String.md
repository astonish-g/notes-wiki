##### Info:
To replace a string, you should use the `replace()` method. This replaces a string with an other string. Here's an example:

```Python
a = "Hello, World!"
print(a.replace("H", "J"))
```

So on the example above, we are telling **Python** to replace the character **H** with the character **J** .
