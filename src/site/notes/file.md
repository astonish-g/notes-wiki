##### Info:
This command gives you information about the **file type** of a file that you have no clue what it is.

##### How to use the command?
For example let's say that you have a file called **1.blend** in the folder where you are and you don't know what it is. You can find out by typing this in *terminal* **while you are inside that folder.**

```bash
garo@hyprland -> file 1.blend
1. blend: Blender3D, saved as 64-bits little endian with version 4.0.1
garo@hyprland -> 
```

As you see on the example above, it shows more information about the **file type** of the file that you are curious.
