##### Info:
In **Python**, there are **three** types of **comments**.

###### Python block comments:
A block comment explains the code that follows it. Typically, you indent a block comment at the same level as the code block. 

**An example:**
```Python
# increase price by 5%
price = price * 1.05
```

###### Python inline comments:
When you place a comment on the same line as a statement, you'll have an inline comment. 

**An example:**
```Python
salary = salary * 1.02 # increase salary by 2%
```

###### Multi-line comments:
Python does **NOT** support **multiline comments**. However, you can use mult-line [[docstrings\|docstrings]] as multiline comments. Even the creator of Python, recommended this according to the tutorial that I have been following.
