##### Info:
In **Python** you can add **variables** in this way. For example let's create a **variable** called ==name==.

```Python
name = ("Garo")
```

As you see above, we have put the name *Garo* as a **string** to the variable. Here's an example of using this variable:

```Python
character_name = ("Garo")
character_age = ("38")
print("He is a man named " + character_name + ", ")
print("and he is " + character_age + " years old.")
```

So the *program* above will give this output

```
He is a man named Garo,
and he is 38 years old.
```

As you can see on the example above, we are adding the *white space* to the **strings** as you need to place the spacing into it, if you want to create a correctly formatted text.

Also you can see that our variables in the examples are called:
- character_name
- character_age

Because in the **Python** coding language, when you use **multiple words**, it is a good practice to **seperate** the **words** with an **underscore** to improve the readability.

>[!Warning]
>You can't use some special characters like !,- in variable names. So, better stick to the words, numbers and underscore.
>
>Even if you can use numbers in variable name, you can NOT start with numbers for the variable names.
>
>Also note that, you can not use some special syntax words such as **if, for** in your variable names as they are reserved for syntaxes.
