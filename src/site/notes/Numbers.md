##### Info:
You can use numbers inside Python and make all kind of mathematical operations with them, without an issue.

###### For example:
```Python
print (3 * 4.5)
```
An this will result in
```
13.5
```
You can also use parenthesis to specify the order of the operations like in real mathematics. For example:
```Python
print(3 * 4 + 2)
```
will result in 
```
14
```
as it will do the multiplication first since there are no paranthesis. And in the example below:
```Python
print(3 * (4 + 2) 
```
will result in
```
18
```
because it will take the sum first and then multiply with 3.
