##### Info:
While editing file, the keybindings for navigating the file can never be enough. Thankfully NVChad developpers has created some very conveniant bindings to navigate the file.

###### Make sure that you are in INSERT mode:
==Ctrl + b :== Go to the **beginning** of the **line**.
==Ctrl + e :== Go to the **end** of the **line**.
==Ctrl + h,j,k.l :== Works like the normal **keybindings** for navigation in **normal** mode.
