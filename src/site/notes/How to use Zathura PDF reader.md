nap##### Info:
When you install it, remember to install the pdf backend as well. I installed the **pdf-poppler** version. Then you open a document with Zathura, with the **right click menu** inside your **file-manager**. I still have to find a different way to do it.

##### Keyboard controls:
==+== : To zoom in
==-== : To zoom out
==\=== : To fit to the screen
==a== : Fit the height to the current window
==s== : Fit the width to the current window
==Ctrl + n== : Toggle status bar
==Ctrl + r== : Recolour / invert colours
==d== : Toggle dual page view
==Ctrl + D== : Move the document half page down
==Shift + L== : Go to the bottom of the selected page
==Shift + H== : Go to the top of the selected page
`number` ==+ \=== : The number you type earlier chooses the zoom level. For example **55 + =** sets the zoom level to 55%.
==Shift + R== : Refresh / Redraw the current document

##### How to remove the bottom bar about the copied and selected test?
1. Press **Shift + ;**
2. This will enter to the command mode. 
3. Then press **Esc** to exit it and the bar will dissappear.
