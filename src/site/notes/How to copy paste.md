##### Info:
Unfortunately, in Neovim, even the copy paste does not work with the normal keys or keybindings. So..

##### How to copy:
There are several keybindings to copy a line, or several lines..etc:
- ==yy :== Copies the line where cursor is.
- ==3yy :== This copies three lines beginning with the line that has the cursor. **You can change the number 3 to any desired number**

##### How to cut?
- ==dd :== This cuts the line that your cursor is in.
- ==3dd :== Like the copy command, this cuts three lines. You can change the number to the number that you desire. 
- ==d$ :== Cuts everything from the cursor to the line's end.

##### How to paste?
- ==p :== Once you bring the cursor to the line where you want to paste, press the **p** key to paste it.
