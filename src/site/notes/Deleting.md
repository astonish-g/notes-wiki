##### Deleting a Word:
1. Enter the **NORMAL** mode.
2. **Move** your **cursor** to the ~~beginning~~ of a **word** that you want to **delete.**
3. **Type** ==dw== 

Then you will see that the word you wanted to delete **will dissappear**.

##### Deleting the end of the line:
1. Enter the **NORMAL** mode.
2. **Move** your **cursor** to the end of the line that you want to **keep**.
3. Type ==d$==

Now you will notice that the rest of the line, the words that remain after your cursor will be deleted.

##### Deleting whole line:
1. In **NORMAL** mode, **move** your **cursor** to the line that you want to delete.
2. While you are on top of the line, type ==dd== 

And the whole line will dissappear.

> Note that you can use **count** with this command as well. For example **d2d** will delete 2 lines or **d3d** will delete three lines..etc.
