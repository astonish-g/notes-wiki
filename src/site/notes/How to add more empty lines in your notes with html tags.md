##### Problem:
Sometimes Obsidian does **not** let you **add** more **empty lines** than what is set by default. You can add as many empty lines as you want, by pressing **enter**, but this will **not render** in the **preview**. 

##### Solution:
To fix this issue, you can **add** more **empty lines** by using **html tags**. The tag that we will be using here is `<br>` , which is the **break line** html tag. 

##### How to use it?
- Add an empty line before the html tag, where you want to place it for an extra empty line.
- Add the `<br>` html tag.
- Add an other empty line after the tag by pressing enter again.
- Then you can start typing. 

>[!Note] 
>I saw that if you do not add empty lines before and after the html tag, it messes the formatting of the previous or the following element/paragraph.

##### Example file:
You can check the link below for an example where I used the `<br>` tag to add extra lines to make my note file prettier.
