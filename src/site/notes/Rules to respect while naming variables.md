##### Info:
Variables are one of the most important elements while coding. In **Python** there are certain **rules** that you should respect while **naming** them.

The following are the variable rules that you should keep in mind: 
- Variable names can **contain only** ==letters, numbers== and ==underscore==. They can **start** with a **letter** or **underscore** but **NOT** with a **number.**
- Variable names can **NOT** contain **spaces**. To separate words in variables, you use **underscores**. For example: `sorted_list` .
- Variable names can **NOT** be the same as **keywords**, **reserved words**, and **built-in functions** in **Python**.
