##### Info:
You can use several methods to achieve the straps. I tried using the metho of creating a vertice by joining the verts of a cube in the center and then by extruding the vertices to the shape of the feet but the result was not very smooth.

##### Method to try:
- You can create two curves.
	- Use one of the curves as profile, so make it smaller and create a shape profile to it.
	- Use the second curve as a path. And try to modify it according to your shape
- Go to the **geometry** section of the **curve properties** tab and **select** your small curve as **profile**.

Still need to find a correct way to create the taper.
