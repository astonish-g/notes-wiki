##### Velka 7
Check this case as well. There is a post of someone putting RTX 4070 Ti Super in it. The dual fan version. Here is a link [Reddit Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/sffpc/comments/1ao5tmn/4070_ti_super_on_velka_7/)

More info coming soon.

##### Formd T1
For this case, they say no compromise case. Interesting too. But it is bigger.
Seems like this could be the best case.
But it looks big though. 

##### Nouvolo:
Check this case as well. Very good specs and cheap.
