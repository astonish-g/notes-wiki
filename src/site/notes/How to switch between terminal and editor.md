##### Info:
When you use **alt + h** to **open** a **terminal** window in **NeoVim**, several times it becomes cumbersome to switch between the editor and the terminal and the regular **h,j,k,l** keys may not achieve the result that you want.

##### Solution:
So when you have opened the terminal with **alt + h**, you can either close and open it to switch back and forth the editor and the terminal 

###### OR:
You can press ==Ctrl + X== and then you can start using ==Ctrl + H,J,K,L== to navigate between the editor and the terminal. And if you are on editor, for this to work, you have to be in **NORMAL** mode.

>[!Note] Remember to press i to enter insert mode even in Terminal when you use the second method!
