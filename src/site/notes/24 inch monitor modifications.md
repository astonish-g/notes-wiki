##### Obsidian:
- **Font Size:** It was 20 px, I changed it to 16px.

##### Wofi:
- Added new **conf-24** and **style-24.css** to the **hyprland** config file which calls those two new configuration files with **shift+D**.

##### Firefox:
- Changed the zoom level from 150% or 130% to 110%.

##### Alacritty:
- Created a new **alacritty-24.toml** file to change the font size and it is being called from **Hyprland** config file with the **shift+enter**.
	- Changed the **font size** from **15 px** to **13 px**.

##### Firestorm Viewer:
- Changed the **Chat Window Font Size** from **Medium** to **Large**.
	- To change it, open **Preferences** and search for **Chat Window Font Size** and then from the setting change it to the desired level. This setting let's you change the chat font size without changing the UI font size.

##### Blender:
- Brought the interface scaling back from **1.10** to **1.0**.
