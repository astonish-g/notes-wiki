##### Info:
Typing a number with an operator, repeats it that many times. Motion is the function that you give to the operator. For example **dw** means **delete word**. So in this example, **d** is the **delete operator** and **w** is the **motion**. 

###### For example:
In the combination of the **delete** operator and a **motion** such as words, combined with a number, you can repeat the operation automatically that many times. 

`:d2w` :
- `d` is the **delete operator**.
- `2` is the **count** that the operation should be **repeated**.
- `w` is the **motion** which in this case, means, word

> So the operation above will delete the two words that are in front of the cursor. You can change the number as you wish such as `d7w` to delete 7 words or you can use different operators or motions.
