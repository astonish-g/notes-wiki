##### Info:
In NVChad, you can select the text with mouse as well, but if you want a more conveniant way with the **keyboard**, you should enter to the **VISUAL** mode. 

###### How to enter to the VISUAL mode?
- Bring your cursor where you want to start the selection.
- Press **Ctrl + V** to enter to the **V-Block** (Visual Block) mode.
- Now when you **move** your **cursor**, you will see that your **selection** will be **highlighted**.

###### What operations can we do with this selection?
- For example if you want to copy it, press the **y** key to **copy** it to the **clipboard**.
- If you want to **delete** it, you can press the **d** key.
