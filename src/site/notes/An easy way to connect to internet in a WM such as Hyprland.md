##### Info:
When you use a Window Manager such as Hyprland, they do not come with simple tray icons that help you to connect to WIFI. You have to use **NMCLI** to connect to the internet but it is quite complicated to remember all the commands.

##### How to solve?
If you have no tray bar, then I suggest you to connect to the internet with this **TUI** tool called `nmtui`. 

It comes with a TUI interface and you can **easily connect** to internet with it.
