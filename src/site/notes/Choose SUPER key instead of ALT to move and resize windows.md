In **Cinnamon** DE, the default key for moving and resizing windows is mapped to **ALT** key. To change it to **SUPER** like in my **window managers**, follow the steps below.

##### Solution:
- Open **System Settings**.
- Go to **Windows** section.
- Go to **Behavior** tab.
- **Change** the **value** of ==Special key to move and resize windows== to **SUPER** key instead of ALT.
